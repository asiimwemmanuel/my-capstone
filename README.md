# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

**Data Analysis: Prices vs. Automobile Pre-Owned Condition**

---

**Objective:**
This project aims to analyze the relationship between pre-owned automobile condition and pricing, with a focus on various car brands. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the automotive industry using rigorous data-driven methods.

**Scope:**
- Analysis utilizes a publicly available dataset of used car listings from diverse car brands and manufacturers.
- Utilizes R for statistical analysis and data visualization.

**Deliverables:**
- Detailed Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and findings.
- Graphs and charts summarizing key discoveries and recommendations for stakeholders.
- GLMs concluding the analysis and findings.

**Data Analysis Project Roadmap**

**ASK PHASE:**
- Objective: Understand how different car brands have different relationships between the age of the car and used car prices.
- End Goal: Create predictive models for future price trends based on car brand.

**PREPARE PHASE:**
- Data Source: Kaggle dataset.
- Data Description: Includes variables like model, selling price, kilometers driven, year of manufacture, owner, fuel type, transmission, insurance, and car condition.

**PROCESS PHASE:**
- Objective: Prepare the dataset for analysis by cleaning, formatting, and transforming variables.

**ANALYSIS PHASE:**
- Objective: Analyze each car model's data to calculate usedness and evaluate linear regression models.

**SHARE PHASE:**
- Objective: Create scatter plots and linear regression plots for each car model.

**ACT PHASE:**
- Objective: Summarize the findings from the analysis and provide recommendations or insights.
